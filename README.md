 Task was to create a program that parses modbus data from tuf-2000m ultrasonic energy meter.
 I created web app that gets the data from my github repo and parses it. And then shows it on a react table.
 I'm still working on with modbus ascii decoding so for now the app is using some CRC function from https://www.npmjs.com/package/crc.
 There is still some architectural changes todo and code commentin before I bublish it.
